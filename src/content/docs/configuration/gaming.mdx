Welcome to the world of gaming on CachyOS, a leading Arch-based distribution! This guide will help you get started with playing your favorite games on this operating system.

## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the fun stuff, it is essential to ensure that your graphics card drivers are installed and working properly. If your graphics card is not functioning optimally, you won't be able to play games properly.

## Essential Packages
To make things easier for you, CachyOS has grouped all the necessary packages for gaming into one meta package. This makes the installation process faster and easier. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
sudo pacman -S cachyos-gaming-meta
```

:::note
The `cachyos-gaming-meta` package installs the following [packages](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-PKGBUILDS/blob/master/cachyos-gaming-meta/PKGBUILD#L10). *If you find that it is missing any package, feel free to let the CachyOS team know.*
:::

## Steam
For Steam users, playing games on CachyOS is a breeze! Simply open Steam and select the Proton option, and you're ready to enjoy your games.
:::note
Notebook users with NVIDIA GPUs should refer to the following guide: [NVIDIA PRIME Render Offload](https://wiki.cachyos.org/configuration/dual_gpu/)
:::

## Proton
Don't worry, Proton is very simple! In just a few clicks, you can have it set up and ready to use. Check out the screenshots below for a step-by-step guide.

<MultipleImageComponent images={[import('~/assets/images/Steam1_Screenshot_20230907_071249.png'), import('~/assets/images/Steam2_Screenshot_20230907_071521.png'), import('~/assets/images/Steam3_Screenshot_20230907_072849.png'), import('~/assets/images/Steam4_Screenshot_20230907_072236.png')]} />

You can use Proton to play your Windows games on Linux.
:::note
To check if your game is compatible with Linux, visit [proton-db](https://www.protondb.com/).
:::
CachyOS provides various Proton versions for improved performance, including `proton-cachyos`, `proton-ge-custom`, `proton-tkg-git`, and the official Proton versions `proton-experimental` and `proton`.

## Performance

### Power Profile Switching on Demand
:::note
This behavior is slightly different with `intel_pstate`. On Intel, the governor remains at powersave but the
EPP/EPB values are set to performance.
:::

CachyOS provides a wrapper script [`game-performance`](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings/blob/master/usr/bin/game-performance)
which uses `power-profiles-daemon` to temporarily switch the current power profile to `performance`.
The `performance` profile increases the system's power levels and changes the CPU governor to performance.

When this script is used to run a game, the system will be set to use the `performance` profile as long as the game is running.
The previously used power profile will be restored once the game is closed. [Feral's GameMode](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode)
has similar behavior but it should not be used as CachyOS ships with [`ananicy-cpp`](https://gitlab.com/ananicy-cpp/ananicy-cpp).

### Proton-CachyOS

Proton-CachyOS is based on proton-experimental and applies a bunch of patches on top of it:
- Wine-staging patches
- Wine Fullscreen FSR
- Reflex support for Wine
- Support for umu-launcher

In addition, proton-cachyos is compiled against native system libraries and compiler instructions which can further improve performance

### Wine-CachyOS

This is a solution similar to proton-cachyos, but as standalone version, which can be used by Lutris, Heroic, Bottles and others.

:::note
Although it can be used as a systemd wide Wine for Desktop Applications, be aware that it might lead to some unexpected behaviors & issues due to being more gaming focused with the patches and changes.
:::

- Based on Valve's bleeding-edge Wine
- Adds early hotfixes/workarounds for games 
- protonfixes
- Support for umu-launcher

**QoL Modifications**

- WINE_WMCLASS: env variable to set the wm class of all wine windows, allowing the wm to control the window through rules.
- WINEUSERSANDBOX: env variable to disable creating symlinks from Wine folders such as Documents/Pictures etc, to the equivalent folders in the user's directory
- Disabled Native Window Decorations
- Changes for optimizing Wine's performance similar as we do with proton-cachyos

## Bottles

Bottles is an application that allows you to easily manage Windows prefixes on your favorite Linux distributions.

Bottles can also make use of different runners like Lutris and are all manageable within the application. Bottles offers the option of a gaming-oriented prefix.
You can also install dependencies, add EXE files, and use their one-click installers for gaming-related apps like EA App or Battle.net.

```sh title="How to install Bottles"
# Open a terminal and run the following command:
sudo pacman -S bottles
```

If you want to know more about it, check out their [documentation](https://docs.usebottles.com/).

## Lutris
Lutris serves as a central hub for all your games on CachyOS. With Lutris, you can efficiently manage your game runners, including Wine, Proton, and emulators. You can even customize their parameters!

```sh title="How to install Lutris"
# Open a terminal and run the following command:
sudo pacman -S lutris
```
## Lutris Guide

### 1. Set the proper Wine runner
Many games perform optimally with the Proton-GE runner, so it's advisable to configure it before installing anything else.
