import MultipleImageComponent from '~/components/multiple-images-component.astro';

Here are some of the common questions. We recommend that users read this, especially those using CachyOS or Arch-based distributions.

## Installation FAQ

### Why is KDE Plasma the only available option in the live environment?

KDE Plasma can be considered as our "flagship" desktop environment, therefore it gets the most maintenance. Other ISOs
were maintained in a half-ass state, if at all so we decided to deprecate them so that we can focus our efforts to deliver
the best user experience.

We recommend installing CachyOS in a VM for testing out different desktop environments and window managers as the live ISO is only
used for installation and recovering a broken install via [cachy-chroot](https://github.com/CachyOS/cachy-chroot).

## Software management FAQ

### How can I fix the "unable to lock database" error in CachyOS?
```sh
sudo rm /var/lib/pacman/db.lck
```
:::tip
You can also achieve this by using **"Remove db lock"** in CachyOS Hello in the **Apps/Tweaks** tab.
:::

### How can I fix possible keyring issues in CachyOS?
```sh
sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/
sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate

sudo pacman-key --recv-keys F3B607488DB35A47 --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key F3B607488DB35A47

sudo rm -R /var/lib/pacman/sync
```

### How can I remove those annoying warnings while updating my system? Is it safe to update the system when this happens?
`warning: X package: local(1.0.1-1.1) is newer than Y repo (1.0.1-1)`
<MultipleImageComponent images={[import('~/assets/images/update-warnings.png')]} />

Yes, it is safe to update the system.

To remove these errors, run the following command:
```sh
sudo pacman -Syuu
```

### When trying to install a package with pacman i received the following error

```code
# Example
sudo pacman -S telegram-desktop    
resolving dependencies...
looking for conflicting packages...

Packages (4) libdbusmenu-qt5-0.9.3+16.04.20160218-5  qt5-imageformats-5.15.2-1
             ttf-opensans-1.101-2  telegram-desktop-2.5.1-1

Total Download Size:   24.10 MiB
Total Installed Size:  67.51 MiB

:: Proceed with installation? [Y/n] Y
:: Retrieving packages...
error: failed retrieving file 'telegram-desktop-2.5.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst' from archlinux.mailtunnel.eu : The requested URL returned error: 404
```

This means that your local database is outdated therefore the package you're asking for can't be downloaded. Run the following command to update your local database:

```sh
sudo pacman -Sy
# Then try to install the package you want again.
```

### What does -bin means at the end of a package name? For example librewolf-bin

This means that you're downloading/installing a prebuilt package therefore you don't need to compile or build it.
In our repositories we store some bin packages which are basically mirrors that you can download from the AUR.

### When I try to open Discord, a window opens notifying me of an update

Example:

<MultipleImageComponent images={[import('~/assets/images/discord-update.png')]} />

This is because Discord released an update that is yet not available or it hasn't been built in any of the pacman mirrors, therefore you get stuck
unable to use Discord. In order to get around this issue, follow [Arch Wiki's fix guide](<https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Discord#Discord_asks_for_an_update_not_yet_available_in_the_repository>).


### I got an error while trying to clear pacman cache

:::tip
You can also clear pacman's cache using CachyOS Hello in **Apps/Tweaks** > **Clear package cache**
:::

Example:

<MultipleImageComponent images={[import('~/assets/images/pacman-cache-error.png')]} />

This usually appears when they're some orphans packages left in `/var/cache/pacman/pkg` which pacman can't delete. Run the following command to fix it.

```sh
# Removes all the orphans stored in pkg cache.
sudo rm -r /var/cache/pacman/pkg/*
```
